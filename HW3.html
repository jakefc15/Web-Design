            Chapter 5:

            1. 
            Static Web Content is a web page that is delivered to the browser exactly as stored at the server.
            Dynamic Web Content is a web page with the content which is generated on-the-fly by the server at 
            the moment of receiving the browser’s requests. PHP is dynamic web content.
            2.
            PHP is not run on your local hard drive, it is run on a PHP-enabled web server and then sent back 
            to the user across the network. PHP code is run before it is sent back to the user.
            3.
            Compiled language has its own compiler that translate the syntax into machine code before runtime. 
            Scripting languages are interpreted line by line during runtime by the interpreter of the platform 
            they are running on.
            
            Chapter 6:
            
            When I attempt to open the chapter 6 lecture notes, the webpage says “Suspicious page blocked”, 
            “This page is blocked for your safety as it has been reported to contain malicious content.” and 
            won’t allow me to open the slides. I have tried to open it with multiple different browsers and 
            have had the same result.
