<h1>Web Development Project: CSS</h1>

<p>Add an <em>internal/embedded style sheet</em> (CSS style sheet embedded in the page's head section as a style element) 
to the webpage constructed in Project 1 (a webpage introducing somebody or something.) 
In order to finish this project, you may need to add more contents to the webpage or create a new webpage from scratch.</p>

<p>With this style sheet, the webpage is displayed by browsers in different and prettier styles than before: </p>

<ol>
	<li>The webpage has a background image or background color other than the default color. Please pay attention in selecting 
background so that the text is easy to read.</li>
	<li>The webpage contains a center-aligned heading which is of a different font family and color than the text.</li>
	<li>In the 2-level nested ordered list, the outer list uses uppercase Roman numerals as list-item markers (sequencing values), and the markers of the inner list are lowercase Greek letters. </li>
	<li>Hypertext links (whose content is text) are in italics but not underlined. </li>
	<li>When the mouse cursor is hovering over a hypertext link, the presentation style of the link changes to make the hypertext link immediately noticeable.
	For example, the background color changes or the hypertext link becomes underlined.</li>
	<li>The two images are displayed with borders, as if they were put into photo frames. </li>
	<li>The odd and even numbered rows of the table have different background colors. </li>
</ol>

<p>The style sheet should be documented with at least one CSS comment.</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="./proj2_hint.html">hints</a> for the project.</p>
